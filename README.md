# Simulation

- graph.py: graph class
- simulation.py: runs the simulations to determine activations
- structure.py: runs the simulations to determine terminating groups 
- plot_simualtion.py: plots initial active set against activations
- plot_structure.py: plots re-wiring probability + clique size against number of terminating groups

Initialise directory to store simulation results to and define the path to the directory in the main function of both simulation.py and plot.py. Next, et the desired settings in the main function of simulation.py. Ensure the changes made to the re-wiring probabilities are consistent in both files.
